## Before getting started
 - A bit about me
 - Why TDD?
 - Code challenge approach
 - What is the Jumble?
 - Directory tour

## To Do

  1. Write test for Jumbler addLetter, which should take in a letter as an argument and add the letter to allLetters.
  2. Create test for rotate, which should take the first letter from allLetters, and move it to the last position.
  3. No more that 10 letters should be added. After 10 letters are in allLetters, it should not get any more letters, even if addLetter is called.
