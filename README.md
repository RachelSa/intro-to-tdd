## Before getting started
 - A bit about me
 - What is TDD?
 - Why TDD?
 - Code challenge approach
 - What is the Jumble?
 - Directory tour

## To Do

  1. Jumbler should have a function `addLetter`, which takes in a letter as an argument and returns `allLetters`.
  2. Jumbler should have a function `rotate`, which takes the first letter from `allLetters`, and moves it to the last position.
  3. No more that 10 letters should be added. After 10 letters are in `allLetters`, it should not add letters to it's length, even if `addLetter` is called.
